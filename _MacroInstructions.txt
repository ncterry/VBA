Here is the basic instructions on creating a macro, and linking it to a button.

How would you create a macro using VBA on an excel worksheet to create a button that when pressed, uses that macro to copy Cells A1:A10 on Sheet1 and transpose them to Sheet2 starting in Column 1, row 10 

 

To create a macro using VBA in Excel to copy cells A1:A10 on Sheet1 and transpose them to Sheet2 starting in Column 1, row 10, follow these steps: 

1) Open your Excel workbook and press Alt+F11 to open the Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) editor. 

2) In the VBA editor, click on "Insert" in the menu, and then select "Module" to insert a new module.

4) Press Ctrl+S to save the workbook (preferably as a macro-enabled workbook, i.e., with a .xlsm file extension). 

5) Now, you need to create a button that will execute this macro: 

6) Go to the "Developer" tab in Excel. If you don't see this tab, you'll need to enable it by going to "File" > "Options" > "Customize Ribbon" and checking the "Developer" checkbox. 

7) Click on "Insert" in the "Controls" group and select the "Form Controls" > "Button" option. 

8) Draw the button on your worksheet by clicking and dragging on the desired location. 

9) In the "Assign Macro" dialog that appears, select the "CopyAndTranspose" macro and click "OK". 

10) Optionally, you can right-click on the button to edit its caption. 

11) Now, when you press the button, the macro will copy cells A1:A10 from Sheet1 and transpose them to Sheet2 starting in Column 1, row 10.
